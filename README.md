Photo album is a project made in java which uses swing and html, Css to build a swing (Graphical) view and a web view. A text file, type of view web or graphical, output file(For web view) and the dimensions are the input. As an output we see the photoAlbum made by using the given text file input.
PhotoAlbum uses the concepts of Object Oriented programming such as 
A) SOLID 
1. Single Responsibility
2. Open/Closed
3. Liskov Substitution
4. Interface Segregation
5. Dependency Inversion

B) (MVC) Model View Controller (Model-View-Controller Pattern is also known as the MVC pattern. This pattern is employed to divide the concerns of an application. Model - Model depicts a data-carrying object or Java POJO. Additionally, if its data changes, it may have logic to update the controller. View - View is a representation of how the model's data is visualized.)

C) Inheritance (A new class can be derived from an existing class by inheritance. In Java, classes may inherit or acquire the properties and methods of other classes. A subclass is a class that has been derived from another class, whereas a superclass is a class from which a subclass has been derived.)

D) Abstract classes (A class that has been declared abstract is one that may or may not have abstract methods. Although they cannot be created from scratch, abstract classes can be subclassed. When a subclass of an abstract class is created, it typically offers implementations for each of the parent class's abstract methods.) and 

E) Interfaces (a collection of methods and constant variables are contained in an abstract type.)
